Description
	Breath and touch analysis sensing technologies to measure the alcohol concentration in breath BrAC with simultanous measure of CO2
	
	Touch Approach
		Detecting Ethanol Molecules in Blood through Skin by touching Sensor
		Blood Spectrometry Analysis
		Possible Start Button Integration for Initial Test
		Very high Accuracy

	Breath approach
		Measure Breath Alcohol Content by capturing breath particles out of open space
		Initial Test as well as Continuous Monitoring
		Potential Enhanced Health Use Cases
			 - Air Quality (CO2 â†’ Drowsiness Detection; Cigarette Smoke; etc.) 
			 - Diagnostics (Diabetes, Sports Performance, Weight Loss Support, etc.)
		PoC and Build Up of first HW/SW Sample ongoing
